# Git Workflow

## Branching Strategy
- Use feature branches named `feat/your-feature-name`
- Bugfix branches named `fix/your-bugfix-name`
- Use PRs to merge into `master` branch

## PR Instructions
- Title format: `feat: <message>` or `fix: <message>`
- Start description with capital letter using imperative mood (Add, Enable, Remove, etc.)
- Don't end with a period
- Don't repeat the type in the description
