Very simple promise based script loader and JSONP

## Non-standard Commands
- Run tests: `npm run test-run`
- Check all (lint + format + types + test): `npm run check-all`

## Plan Mode
- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- End every plan with a numbered list of concrete steps. This should be the last thing visible in the terminal.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
